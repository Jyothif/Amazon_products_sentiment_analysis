# Amazon_products_sentiment_analysis : Project_OverView

* This Project consists of **34000 consumer reviews** of Amazon  products I have been implemented  the multinomialNB, Bernouli and Logistic regression Algorithms for this dataset and also found some interesting accuracies of the algorithms

# Resources and requirements


# Scraping of Data

* I found the data in Kaggle.com at link: https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products

# Data Cleaning

* In this section checked and solved about  nullvalues and text cleaning present in the dataset as our

# EDA

* some of the visualization of the data are here

# Model Building
* I implemented  Naive Bayes, Multinomail,Bernouli's, and LogisticRegression 

# Model Performance

* Test accuracy metrics ar as follows:

* **Model Accuracy**
  * Naive Bayes : 58.9%
  * Multinomial : 93.2%
  * Bernouli    : 92.0%
  * LogisticRegression : 93.7%
